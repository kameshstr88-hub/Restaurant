Reestar is a simple and responsive food website built using HTML and CSS. It displays food recipes in a clean card-based layout and adapts smoothly to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens using Flexbox and media queries. This project helped me understand responsive design, layout structuring, and basic UI styling.
